This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur in HTML, especially when dealing with dynamically generated content or elements that may not always exist in the DOM. The first example showcases an issue with using getElementById to select an element with a dynamically generated ID. The second example shows how to properly handle situations where an element you're trying to access may not exist, preventing null reference errors.  The solution file provides a corrected approach.
